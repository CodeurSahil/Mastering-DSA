> **Data Structures** is a way to organise and store data in a computer system so that it can be accessed, processed, and retrieved quickly and efficiently for various uses.
> - They provide a structured way to arrange data so that algorithms can work efficiently, which is especially important for large or complex data sets. 
> - They are a fundamental concept in computer science and are essential for solving various computational problems effectively.

### Types of Data Structures:-
1. **Primitive Data Structures**
    - **Integers, Floats, Characters, Booleans**: These are the basic types that store single pieces of data, like a number or a letter. Theyâ€™re the building blocks for more complex structures.
2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**
    - These data structures can store multiple values and are generally more complex. They can be further divided into two main categories: **Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures**.

## Linear Data Structures
- In LDS, Data Elements are arranged in Linear Order i.e. in single line, where each and every elements are attached to its previous & next adjacent element 
- Single level is Involved 
- Easy Implementation 
- Data Elements can be traversed in single run 
- Memory is utilised efficiently 

### Types of **Linear Data Structures**
1. **Array** - [Know More ðŸ“š](1.%20Array/README.md)
