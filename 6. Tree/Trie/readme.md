## Trie: The Ultimate Prefix Tree üîç

A **Trie** (pronounced "try"), also known as a **Prefix Tree**, is a specialized tree-like data structure designed for the extremely fast storage and retrieval of strings.

Its key difference from other trees is that a node's position within the trie defines the character sequence, rather than the node itself storing a full key. This structure makes it incredibly efficient for prefix-based operations.

Think of it like an auto-completing dictionary. As you type the letters 'C', then 'A', then 'T', you are physically navigating a path down the tree's branches. Every word in the dictionary that starts with "cat" (like "caterpillar" or "catch") will branch off from that point.

## How It Works: The Structure

The unique structure of a trie is what gives it its power.

* **The Nodes:**
    * A node in a trie does not store a character itself. Instead, it contains an array of pointers (or a hash map), one for each possible character in the alphabet (e.g., 26 pointers for lowercase English letters).
    * The **edge** leading from a parent to a child represents a character.

* **The `isEndOfWord` Marker:**
    * This is a crucial boolean flag within each node. It is set to `true` if the path from the root to this specific node forms a complete, valid word.
    * This allows the trie to distinguish between a word like "car" and the prefix "car" which is part of another word like "cart".

* **The Root:**
    * The root node of the trie represents an empty string (`""`). All words are formed by paths starting from this root.

## Operations and Algorithms

Trie operations involve traversing the tree character by character.

* **Insert(word)**
    * **Goal:** Add a new word to the trie.
    * **Algorithm:**
        1.  Start with a `current` pointer at the `root` node.
        2.  For each character in the `word`, find the child pointer corresponding to that character.
        3.  If the pointer is `null`, create a new node and link it from the `current` node at that character's position.
        4.  Move the `current` pointer to the child node.
        5.  After the loop finishes, mark the `current` node's `isEndOfWord` flag as `true`.

* **Search(word)**
    * **Goal:** Check if a complete word exists in the trie.
    * **Algorithm:**
        1.  Start with a `current` pointer at the `root`.
        2.  For each character in the `word`, try to follow the corresponding child pointer.
        3.  If at any point a pointer is `null`, the path is broken, and the word does not exist. Return `false`.
        4.  After the loop finishes, return `true` only if the `current` node's `isEndOfWord` flag is `true`.

* **startsWith(prefix)**
    * **Goal:** Check if any word in the trie starts with the given prefix.
    * **Algorithm:**
        1.  Follow the same traversal logic as the `Search` algorithm for the given `prefix`.
        2.  If the traversal completes without hitting a `null` pointer, it means the prefix exists. Return `true`. (You do not need to check the `isEndOfWord` flag).

## Key Properties

* **Prefix-Based Structure:** The tree's structure is a direct, physical representation of the prefixes of all the words it stores.
* **Path Represents Key:** A path from the root to any node corresponds to a unique prefix. A path to a node marked as `isEndOfWord` represents a complete key.
* **No Key Storage in Nodes:** Nodes themselves are generally empty of data, only containing an array of child pointers and a boolean flag.

## Advantages üëç

* **Extremely Fast Prefix Searching:** This is the trie's main advantage. Finding all words with a given prefix is exceptionally efficient.
* **Time Complexity Independent of Dataset Size:** The time to search, insert, or delete a word depends only on the **length of the word (`L`)**, not the total number of words (`n`) in the trie. This is a huge advantage over balanced BSTs, where operations are `$O(L \log n)`.
* **Space Efficient for Common Prefixes:** Words with common prefixes (like "team", "tear", "tell") share the initial part of their structure in the trie, which can save a significant amount of space.

## Disadvantages üëé

* **High Memory Usage:** This is the primary drawback. Each node could potentially store an array of pointers for every character in the alphabet. For a large alphabet like Unicode, and for data without many shared prefixes, this can lead to enormous memory consumption.
* **Not a General-Purpose Structure:** It is highly specialized for string-based keys and prefix operations. It's not a suitable replacement for a general key-value store like a hash table.

## Applications

A trie is the go-to data structure for almost any problem involving prefixes of strings.
* **Autocomplete and Search Suggestions:** The most famous application, used by search engines, code editors, and mobile keyboards.
* **Spell Checkers and Dictionaries:** For quickly looking up words and providing suggestions for misspelled words.
* **IP Routing Tables:** Routers use tries to find the "longest prefix match" to determine the most specific route for network packets.
* **T9/Predictive Text:** The underlying technology for predictive text on older mobile phone keypads.

## Time Complexity Summary

The complexity is defined by `L`, the length of the word or prefix being processed.

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| :--- | :---: |
| **Insert** | `$O(L)` |
| **Search** | `$O(L)` |
| **startsWith (Prefix Search)** | `$O(L)` |
| **Delete** | `$O(L)` |
